# Meow — the Slack Bot with the smart paw.
Meow is a little modified Maneki-neko. At first sight, she looks like any other happy lucky cat but once she’s connected to a WiFi network and integrated to your Slack environment, Meow starts to wave directly after you’ve received a Slack message.


### How to setup: 
You can find the WiFi credentials for the inital soft access point in the /data folder. 

```json
{"wifi_ssid" : "Meow", "wifi_pass" : "smartpaw"}
```
